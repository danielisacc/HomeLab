# Active Directory HomeLab Project
## Summary
This guide covers how to create an Active Directory (AD) within a Hyper-V VM to gain experience working with AD's and servers in general. This project is a deep dive into Active Directory and VM's and is suited for people who are rather new to AD, but have some experience working with computers and as such, this document is rather verbose and descriptive. In order to make this experience more pleasant for everyone, I included a table of contents with links to allow anyone viewing to search for information that is valuable to them. This project covers the content regarding...
